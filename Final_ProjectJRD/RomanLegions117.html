				<p>Cobbled together with citzens from Vienna and sailors from the Misenum fleet during thew war of seccession, the 1st Adiutrix would fight for the losing side before proving itself under Trajan, ending their illustrious career with Stilicho's desperate defense of Italy from the Visgoths in the fifth-century.</p>
				<p class="hide" id="firstAdiutrix">In late 68 CE, Nero raised a new legion, taking the unprecedented step of enlisting sailors from the Roman battle fleet based at Misenum. This was unprecedented because sailors were not citizens (they weren’t slaves either but salaried free men), and recruitment into the Roman Legion had been, up to that point, exclusively from the Roman citizenry. However, Nero, at the age of 30, committed suicide after his guards deserted him, leaving the sailors without an eagle and standards and, more importantly, without the citizenship they were promised outside the gates of a overcrowded Rome. The Senate had already recognized the claim to the throne to 70-year-old Sulpicius Galba, who was the governor of Nearer Spain. As Galba approached Rome he was rushed by the 5,000 sailors who demanded enlistment, they became increasingly vocal about their demands, scaring Galba who order his cavalry to “ride over them”, killing many and incarcerating the rest. The ensuing slaughter and imprisonment of the mostly unarmed sailors was not well received by Romans around the Empire and was considered a bad omen to the start of his reign.
				<br>
				<br>
				Before Nero committed suicide, the city of Vienna in Narbon Gaul raised a "legions" to defend itself from possible attack by the 1st Italica who were stationed in the neighboring city of Lugdunum. The two cities had a rivalry that stretched back to the first-century BCE and Vienna supported Galba and the other Nero, thus the citizens of Lugdunum tried to persuade the 1st Italica to attack Vienna. The elders of Vienna claimed they were creating a legion to support the 1st Italica, hence the name 1st Adiutrix, or 1st Supporter Legion; literally, the legion in support of the 1st. As Galba passed through the province, Vienna presented the troops they had raised for him, he took them back to Rome and officially commissioned them into service. Galba was killed by a disgruntled legionary of the 15th Apollinaris and the Praetorian Guards hailed Otho, who had marched with Galba to Rome the previous autumn, as emperor and the Senate endorsed the choice. One of his first moves was to release the remaining sailors from captivity and enlisted them into the 1st Adiutrix.
				<br>
				<br>
				Less than two months after the seaman officially joined the legion, they were sent off into battle against the forces of Vitellius in 69 CE. Ironically, they would face the 1st Italica, they legion it was created to counter, at the First Battle of Bedriacum. Otho’s army lost, the legion surrendered, and Vitellius sent it to Spain. In 70 CE, it was sent to the Mogontiacum on the  Rhine by new emperor Vespasian, where it participated in the defeat of the Civilis Revolt. It was removed from the Rhine and sent to Pannonia by Domitian. During the reign of Nerva is was stationed at Brigetio, on the Danube. It would become front and center for both of Trajan’s Dacian Wars, performing well enough that Trajan took it to the East with him for his Parthian campaign. It was sent back to Brigetio, by Hadrian, where it would stay for the next 200 years defending the Danube. The records show it was still in existence early in the fifth-century as part of the army of the Eastern Roman emperor, under the command of the Duke of Valeriae Ripensis.</p>

				<p>The decendent of Pompey the Great's most elite legion, it won and then quickly lost the esteemed ‘Augusta’ title during the Cantabrian Wars, but gained a new one, ‘Germanica’, fighting Arminius’ Germans for Germanicus, only to disgrace itself by turning traitor in the Civilis Revolt, earning it’s abolishment.</p>
				<p class="hide" id="firstGermanica">After valiantly fighting for Pompey during the civil war at all the major battles, Pharsalus, Thapsus, and Munda, it eventually, as all the legions did, end up in the hands of Augustus. It was sent to Spain to fight in the Cantabrian Wars, where it was given the title ‘Augusta’ for it’s valiant service around 25 BCE. Marcus Agrippa stripped the legion of this title for cowardice when the war flared up again in 19 BCE. He then transferred it to Gaul. By 9 CE, it was stationed at what would be Colonia Agrippinensis with the 5th Alaudae, as part of the army of the Lower Rhine (ALR). It participated in a mutiny in 14 CE, before taking part in Germanicus Caesar’s retaliatory campaigns into Germany. In the 15 CE Battle of the Long Bridges it saved the army commander Aulus Caecina as a pivotal point. It was given the honorific ‘Germanica’ as recognition for its duty, the only legion of seven to receive a title.
				<br>
				<br>
				On the 1st of January 69 CE, the legions of the Rhine were required to take their annual oath to the emperor, who at this point was Galba, but the legions would not have it. It was the commander of the 1st Germanica, Fabius Valens, who led the movement to hail Vitellius, commander of the army of the Upper Rhine (AUR), as emperor. After Galba was assassinated and replaced by Otho, several cohorts of the 1st Germanica marched to Italy with Valens to overthrow the new emperor. They were victorious at the First Battle of Bedriacum and succeeded in overthrowing Otho, but the remainder of the legion was caught up in the Cvilis Revolt and had surrendered to the rebels. Then the cohorts in Italy were defeated by Vespasian’s legions. While the remaining Rhine cohorts of the 1st defected back into Vespasian’s army and helped end the Civilis Revolt at the Battle of Old Camp, Vespasian was so disgusted with the legion’s involvement with the rebels that he disbanded it the same year.</p>

				<p>Raised by Nero in 66 CE for an invasion of Parthia, it was sidelined because of the Jewish Revolt, won it’s first battle but not it’s second, then was sent to the Danube border where it would fight off successive invasions by the Germans, Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns.</p>
				<p class="hide" id="firstItalica">Nero created the 1st Italica Legion in 66 CE to be part of one of two massive military operations in the East. The first was a push into Ethiopia from Egypt, and the other, which the 1st was made for, was an invasion of Parthia. The 1st was unique because was the first legion recruited in Italy for a century, and  Nero wanted all of the men to be 6 (Roman) feet tall, and equipped in the manner of a Macedonian phalanx; small round shields, spears 4-6 meters (13-20 feet) long, and a tight forward facing formation. Unfortunately for Nero, but likely fortunate for the men of the 1st, the Jewish Revolt of that same year erupted and put those plans on hold. Instead the 1st was sent to Lugdunum in 67 CE to maintain order after the short Vindex Revolt. When Vitellius was hailed as emperor in 69 CE, the legion swore loyalty to Vitellius and marched into Italy to help him with the First Battle of Bedriacum. It was then posted to Novae in Moesia where it would remain, apart from service in Trajan’s Dacian Wars, until the fourth-century CE.</p>

				<p>Created by Domitian for his Chattian War, if fought the Dacians for over 20 year with two emperors before being sent to the East to fight the Parthians with another emperor, it returned to the Rhine and held off invaders till it’s end in early fifth-century.</p>
				<p class="hide" id="firstMinervia">With a thirst for military glory, Domitian raised a new legion in 82 CE with the intent to attack the Chatti tribe of Germany, a Roman ally. He named this legion after his favorite deity, the goddess Minerva, and stationed it at Bonna on the Rhine, opposite the Chattian homeland. The newly christened 1st Minervia launched the surprise attack the following year and won a swift victory. It was posted to Moesia by Trajan for the purpose of being part of his Dacian Wars, then sent back to Bonna after it’s completion. Marcus Aurelius transferred the legion to the east for his operations against the Parthians in 161 CE, after which it returned to Bonna in 167 CE. They fought for Septimius Severus in the civil wars that broke out after he took the throne in 193 CE, leading Severus forces to victory against Albinus at the Battle of Lugdunum. They stayed as an occupying force for four years, treating the locals harshly for their support of Albinus, Lugdunum never regained it’s former importance. It returned to Bonna where it stayed to stem the flow of invaders until Stilicho recalled it to defend Italy from the Visigoths, in 401 CE. After Stilicho’s death, it appears the legion was destroyed by the Visigoths just before their infamous sack of Rome.</p>

				<p>Created using the same mismatch of recruits as the 1st Adiutrix for Vitellius, it was used by Vespasian against Civilis, later fighting in Britain for a decade before holding back invaders on the Danube, it would marched on Rome to make Septimius Severus emperor.</p>
				<p class="hide">While officially becoming a legion on the 7th of March 70 CE by decree of the new emperor Vespasian and at the same time giving it the honorific ‘Pia Fidelis’, the real beginning of the 2nd Adiutrix Pia Fidelis (2nd A-P-F) was much more complicated and irregular than most legions. Just as the 1st Adiutrix before, the bulk of it’s recruits came from the town of Vienna, who, after giving their first legion to Galba, needed to raise another to counter the threat from the town of Lugdunum and the 1st Italica stationed there, once again under the guise that it was to support the 1st Italica, thus the 2nd Adiutrix Legion or 2nd Supporter Legion was born. The Viennase’s fears were well founded, for when Vitellius was hailed emperor and the 1st Italica marched toward Italy to join his army they had to pass Vienna and, inspired by the citizens of Lugdunum, they were eager to loot the city. Vienna was spared a sacking however, when they agreed to pay a small fortune to Manlius Valens, the commander of the 1st Italica, who disrupted 300 sesterces (equal to four months pay) to each legionary. They legion marched on but not before disarming the entire city of Vienna, leaving the city and it’s recruits without weapons.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the opening campaign between the short two-month war, Otho sent a naval force with several cohorts of the Praetorian Guard to blockade Narbo Gaul. The force, consisting of the Praetorians and marines, came ashore at Forum Julii, a port city with a important strategic position along the entry way into Italy. They were joined by a large group of ‘rustics’(Roman jargon for unsophisticated country people), likely the men that made up the unarmed legion of Vienna, who helped them win two clashes against veteran forces of Vitellius by using slings. However, Otho lost the war and the forces at Forum Julii disbanded, the Praetorians being discharged without pay and the locals returning to their homes. But when Vespasian was hailed emperor by the legions of the East and then shortly after by the legions on the Danube and in the Balkans, a former general of Otho, Suetonius Paulinus, raised a banner for Vespasian at Forum Julii; Paulinus’ home town. The disbanded forces enthusiastically rallied around Paulinus and took over Forum Julii making it the first city in the West to raise a banner for Vespasian. Leaving the ‘rustics’, who had been rearmed properly, to hold the city, Paulinus took the ex-Praetorians over the Alps to link up with the forces from Pannonia.
				<br>
				<br>
				After Vespasian became emperor, he officially commissioned the 2nd A-P-F and added to it marines from both battle fleets, who had supported him in his bid for the throne, as a reward for their service. The city of Vienna was not honored in any official way, but it was allowed to build a circus for chariot-racing, the building of circus being strictly regulated by the emperors. It’s popularity meant that building one in your city would attract huge crowds, boosting the economy and prestige of the city. As for the 2nd A-P-F, it’s reward was the honorific ‘Pia Fidelis’ and, as a newly minted and full staffed legion, to march against Civilis alongside several well-established and veteran legions. After which it was sent to Britain where it helped the Romans complete the conquest of Wales, and then took part in Agricola’s campaigns which took the legion into Scotland in 84 CE. It was then sent to Singidunum, where it took part in Domitian’s humiliating defeats at the hands of the Dacians and Alemanni. It was then transferred to Aquincum, where it was posted until Marcus Aurelius sent it East with the 1st Minervia to participate in his Parthian Campaigns of 161-166 CE and returned to Aquincum after the war was over. It then joined it’s fellow Pannonian legions in the march on Rome for Septimius Severus, after which it returned to Aquincum where records show it was still located at the beginning of the fifth-century CE.</p>

				<p>Earning the honorific ‘Augusta’ for it’s service in the Cantabrian Wars, under the commander Vespasian it won more than thirty battles against King Caratacus in Britain, but would disgrace itself during the the Boudicca Revolt, before spending many years stamping out Welsh resistance.</p>
				<p class="hide">After the civil wars that ended the Roman Republic, the 2nd was sent to Spain to take part in the grueling Cantabrian Wars, where it gained it’s honorific. It was then sent to the Rhine following the disaster that was the Battle of Teutoberg Forest, where Rome lost three legions, in 9 CE to replace fallen legions. It then participated in Germanicus’ campaign into Germania, 14-16 CE, in search of the one who orchestrated the destruction of those fallen legions, Arminius, and the recovery of the lost eagle standards. Germanicus was recalled in 17 CE, and the 2nd was sent to Argentoratum. In 43 CE, it took part in Claudius’ invasion of Britain, as one of four legions. Under command of the future emperor Vespasian, then a praetor, the 2nd Augusta pushed along the Southern coast of England in an impressively efficient advance that overran all opposition, fighting thirty battles, taking twenty towns, and occupying the Isle of Wight. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The 2nd Augusta stopped it’s advance at Isca Dumnoniorum, where it built a 42-acre permanent base which became it’s home for several decades. While the legion was in Britain during the Boudiccan Revolt, it’s camp-prefect infamously ignored orders to march in support of the governor, Suetonus Paulinus; the camp-prefect later committed suicide.In 67 CE, elements of the legion were moved to Glevum, then eight years later the whole legion was moved to Isca, while completely abandoning it’s Exeter base. Between the years 122-136 CE, vexillations participated in the construction fo the famous Hadrian Wall. Then in 290 CE, the 2nd dismantled it’s base at Isca and transferred to Carpow in Scotland, to contend with incursions made by the Picts and Scots. By around 390 CE, the legion was located at Richborough in Kent, but the unit was a shadow of it’s former self. Now only about a tenth it’s original size, it would end it’s days as a small frontier guard unit under the command of the Count of the Saxons Shore.</p>

				<p>Taking the name of the emperor that raised it, the 2nd Traiana fought for him against the Parthians and took their capital, ending it’s days in Egypt.</p>
				<p class="hide">In 105 CE, Emperor Trajan levied two legions for his planned operations in the coming years, one for the second invasion of Dacia and the other for his planned invasion of Parthia. The 2nd Traiana was one of those two legions. Given the number two because of the it’s recruiting area on the Rhine; Hercules, patron deity of the legion, was equivalent to the German god of war, Donar. It was quickly sent to the port city of Laodicea where it waited to participate in the invasion of Parthia. During the invasion, which began in 111 CE, the 2nd participated in the taking of the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon. It returned to Syria and then made it’s way down to Nicopolis in Egypt where it remained, possibly contributing vexillations to stomp out the Second Jewish Revolt of 132-135 CE. In 172 CE, Bucoli herdsmen of the Nile Delta rose up in revolt, lead by a Egyptian priest named Isodorus, and defeated the auxiliary force sent to deal with them. They then besieged Alexandria, which was defended by the 2nd Traiana until the siege could be lifted a year later and the revolt was put down. Presumably, the legion sided with Queen Zenobia of Palmyra in 269 CE when she seized Egypt, because there isn’t a record of them fighting her. As of the fifth-century CE, the records show it was one of six legions based in Egypt, under the command of the Duke of Thebes.</p>

				<p>Earning it’s keep by putting down the long-lasting Tacfarinas’ Revolt in Tunisia for Emperor Tiberius, it was disbanded for it’s loyalty to the Emperor Maximinus only to be reformed 15 years later, for hundreds of years they were the sole legion in North Africa.</p>
				<p class="hide">After the civil wars that made Octavian an emperor, he changed his named to Augustus in 29 BCE until he died in 14 CE. Sometime between then the 3rd was given his honorific, it is suggested, with some merit, that it was given the title after the governor, Cornelius Balbus, after a series of successful campaigns against desert tribes in 19 BCE, the same time three other legions gained the same title, except for their roles in the Cantabrian Wars. During this time, the legion was also fighting against the rebels led by Tacfarinas, who’s revolt they finally put down in 23 CE. In 75 CE, the 3rd was transferred to Teresa from their base at Lambaesis, where, in addition to building a new base, it built a town which it continued to work on for another half-century. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In 238 CE, leading citizens of the province of Africa  rebelled against the Emperor Maximinus, declaring Gordian I and Gordian II co-emperors. However, the 3rd Augusta remained loyal to the emperor and crushed the usurpers’ army of raw levies outside Carthage, and in the ensuing slaughter Gordian II was killed, which caused Gordian I to commit suicide out of sadness. But the Senate despised Maximinus, and they declared two of their members, Pupienus Maximus and Balbinus, as co-emperors. In response, Maximinus marched his legions from Pannonia and besieged the pro-Senate forces at Aquileia, unfortunately for him, his own troops murdered him in his camp. The Praetorian Guard then murder Pupienus and Balbinus, declaring Gordian I’s 13-year-old grandson, Gordian III, to become the next emperor, and because of the 3rd Augusta was responsible for death of Gordian III’s grandfather and uncle, it was disbanded and the men distributed to other units around the empire.
				<br>
				<br>
				Fifteen years later, in 253 CE, a year of three emperors, the 3rd Augusta was reformed by Valerian, with Sattonius Jucundus as chief centurion, Sattonius having previously served with the 3rd before it’s disbanding. With Africa in a peaceful state, it sent vexillations to Europe frequently, until it was withdraw from Africa and numbered among the comitatense legions under the command of the Master of Foot. It’s men were then recruited in Gaul, and it remained in Europe until it was sent back by Stilicho to Africa to put down Africa’s rebel governor, Gildo, in 395 CE.</p>

				<p>The resident legion of Egypt for many years, Trajan used it to occupy and annex the new province of Arabia, serving valiantly in Trajan’s Parthian campaigns, it put helped put down the Second Jewish War, banning all Jews from within sight of Jerusalem.</p>
				<p class="hide">After becoming one of Augustus’ twenty-eight standing legions, it was posted to Egypt. The men of the 3rd were from Cyrenaica, and as such known to venerate the god Ammon, similar to the Roman Jupiter but with horns, and as such this was likely their officially recognized emblem. Based in Alexandria, the legion put down Jewish rioting in that city in the first-century CE and contributed cohorts to Titus for his 70 CE siege of Jerusalem. In 106 CE, it left it’s base of Alexandria to join a task force led by the governor of Syria, Aulus Cornelius Palma, to invade the old kingdom of Nabataea. On the orders of Trajan, Palma created the Roman province Arabia Petraea out of the new conquest and the 3rd built a base at Bostra. The legion was used by Trajan during his Parthian campaigns, after which it returned to Bostra. It then took part in Julius Severus’s slow, grueling operation to take Judea back from the Jewish rebels. It returned to Bostra after putting down the Jewish rebels, where it would remain for the next few hundred years, regularly fighting Persians with mixed results. At the end of the fourth-century CE, records show that the 3rd was still in Arabia, joined by the 4th Martia Legion, a relatively new creation, plus twelve mounted units and five auxiliary cohorts</p>

				<p>Losing three cohorts at the outset of the First Jewish Revolt, it was badly mauled in subsequent clashes before they were transferred to Moesia where they single-handedly eliminated 9,000 Sarmatian cavalry, this feared legion the led the way into Italy to defeat Vitellius and make it’s former general, Vespasian, emperor.</p>
				<p class="hide">After the civil war, Octavian sent the sun-worshiping Syrians, who worshiped the Eastern sun god of Baal also known as Elagabalus, of the 3rd Gallica to Judea. In 58 CE, they sent a vexillation of six cohorts to Cappadocia to take part in Corbulo’s first quick campaign into Armenia, four years later another vexillation participated in Corbulo’s second Armenian campaign. When the First Jewish Revolt erupted in Judea in 66 CE, three of the 3rd’s cohorts were caught by surprise and were wiped out, and the legions remaining cohorts led Vespasian’s 67 CE counter-offensive into Galilee. Despite, or perhaps because of their revenge fueled enthusiasm, the legion suffered so many casualties that the Palatium transferred them to Moesia on the Danube to recoup their losses, where which they arrived in 68 CE.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the winter of 69 CE, legion’s legate learned that 9,000 Roxolani, a tribe of the Sarmatians, had crossed the frozen Danube. Without hesitating the depleted legion marched out to meet them and in a surprise attack against the Roxolani camp, the 3rd slaughtered them to a man, with few loses of their own. In the summer of that same year, the 3rd learned that their former commander, Vespasian, had been hailed as emperor by the legions of the East. The legion quickly swore fro Vespasian and managed to convince the legions of Moesia, Pannonia, and Dalmatia to do the same. They then led the way into Italy and where at the forefront in the Second Battle of Bedriacum and the Battle of Cremona. At Cremona, all authors agree that a single legionary of the 3rd, Gaius Volusius, entered the camp first, fighting his way though the camp to the rampart, where he waved his hand and shouted that the camp had been taken. They then took Rome and looted the homes of Vitellius supporters and were sent to Capua, where they did the same.
				<br>
				<br>
				The 3rd Gallica was sent back to the East in 70 CE, to the remote settlement, Raphanaea in Syria. The 3rd participated in the Roman counter-offensive against the Jewish rebels in the Second Jewish Revolt of 132-135 CE. After it was returned to Raphanaea during the reign of Marcus Aurelius until 273 CE when it part of Emperor Aurelian’s campaign to take the East back from Queen Zenobia of Palmyra. During the reign of Diocletian, the 3rd was based at Danaba (modern-day Al-Hafar, Syria). By the late fourth-century CE, the legion was still in Danaba along with the 1st Illyricorum Legion, a unit created in the late third-century CE.</p>

				<p class="hide">The 4th Macedonica likely earned it’s honorific from the 42 BCE Battle of Philippi, where it took heavy casualties but still managed to hold the left wing for Mark Anthony. After the end of the civil wars, it was sent to Juliobriga by Augustus, to build a legionary base. It remained there until 43 CE, when Emperor Claudius posted it at Mogontiacum on the Upper Rhine to replace the 14th G-M-V, which was being tasked for the invasion of Britain. This legion led the movement to hail Vitellius as emperor and sent several cohorts to Italy with him. These cohorts, along with the rest of Vitellius’ forces were defeated and surrendered. Unfortunately, they became embroiled in the Civilis Revolt and surrendered to the rebels. After crushing the revolt, Vespasian was so disgusted with the legion’s performance that he disbanded the legion.</p>

				<p>Winning it’s title against Scythian invaders of Moesia and Macedonia under Augustus, to taking the fight to the Parthians with Trajan, it would eventually, like most legions, because of bulwark of the Roman defensive lines, this one along the Euphrates, till the end of it’s career.</p>
				<p class="hide">In the aftermath of the civil wars, there were two 4th legions, one belong to Mark Anthony and the other to Octavian. The 4th Macedonica, Anthony’s legion, was sent to Spain, while Octavian’s 4th Legion, which was without a title, was posted to Macedonia along with the 5th and 10th legions. In 29 BCE, Marcus Licinius Crassus, the grandson of the famous Crassus of the first triumvir who perished with 20,000 of his troops at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BCE, used the 4th to destroy the invading Bastarnae, a Scythian tribe, in several battles in Macedonia and Moesia. For this victory he was award a Triumph by the Senate, while the 4th as given the honorific ‘Scythica’. In 9 CE, the 4th was moved to Moesia and then rotated back and forth between there and Macedonia until 62 CE, when it was shipped to Syria to take part Caesennius Paetus ill-planned and poorly executed offensive. The 4th Scythica, along with the 12th Fulminata, advanced into Armenia only to get themselves surrounded and besieged in their camp by the Parthians. Paetus had to agree to humiliating terms and the legions withdrew with their tails between their legs. Rome did not forgive this poor performance, and the legion was sent to Zeugma on the Euphrates, a remote border settlement opposite Parthia.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 66 CE, the 4th Legion sent several cohorts to assist the army tasked to retake Jerusalem from the Jewish rebels of the First Jewish Revolt. This army was repulsed and had to retreat to the legionary stronghold at Caesarea and once again the 4th was associated with failure, and it was ignored by Vespasian and Titus for their planned counter-offensive that finally ended the revolt. However, during the Second Jewish Revolt, it’s cohorts were successful in helping put down the rebels thus gaining some of it’s original reputation back. Records show it remained in Syria but was eventually moved to Sura, as of the late fourth-century.</p>

				<p>Famous for it’s role at the Battle of Thapsus under Julius Caesar, it would lose it’s eagle in on the Rhine in 15 BCE, and be wiped out by the Dacians during the reign of Domitian.</p>
				<p class="hide">At the Battle of Thapsus the 5th Legion, spread out along both wings of Caesar’s line, turned back 60 elephants of King Juba in Numidia. After this battle, the elephant became the legion’s emblem, and could be found on their standards and shields. The title Alaudae comes from he Gallic auxiliaries that Caesar recruited, trained and equipped in the Roman style. As recognition for their service to him, he gave them full citizenship and they became a full legion in their own right. Sometime between the years of 45 BCE to 30 BCE, likely before 43 BCE but it is unknown, the 5th and Alaudae Legions were merged to form the 5th Alaudae Legion, making it the first known legion to have an official number and title, something that was unheard of prior to the death of Julius Caesar. After the civil wars, it was sent to Spain where it fought in the 29-19 BCE Cantabrian Wars, and upon completion of that war was sent to the Rhine frontier in 17 BCE.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 16 BCE, the 5th was advancing to intercept a force of three German tribes, the Sugambri, Usipetes, and Tencteri, when they swept aside the forward cavalry force sent to meet them and surprised the 5th. In the intense fighting that took place, the Germans took the eagle from the legion as it fell back. Fortunately for the 5th, the Germans learned that Augustus himself was in Gaul and they withdrew across the Rhine and made a peace with the emperor by providing hostages. However, the damage had been done and the reputation of the 5th was stained. 30 years later, it joined Germanicus Caesar in his 14-16 CE campaigns into Germany, and then 12 years later turning back the Frisii, a Germanic tribe, in a pitched battle in 28 CE. The legion sent some of it’s cohorts to Italy for Vitellius, the ones that stayed at Vetera were savaged by Civilis’ rebels and the legion was almost exterminated. It was later sent to Pannonia in 70 CE to recover, only to be completely wiped out by the Dacians in 86 CE, never to be mentioned again in Roman records, and never to be reformed.</p>

				<p>A busy and well traveled legion, it first served in Macedonia, then marched for Corbulo in Armenia, put down the First Jewish Revolt in Judea, serving for Trajan in his Dacian Wars, before returning to the East to take on the Parthians for Marcus Aurelius.</p>
				<p class="hide">Serving in Macedonia after the civil wars, it seems to have earned it’s title from the fighting it did there between 30 BCE to 6 CE, probably in the same battles where the 4th Scythica earned it’s title. It was then transferred to Oescus in Moesia where it remained until 62 CE, when it was transferred to the East by Nero’s Palatium to take part in the Second Armenian campaign. It was sidelined by the over-confident Caesennius Paetus, who took only two legions with him and paid for that over-confidence dearly. Domitius Corbulo used the legion for his Armenian campaign to great effect and then sent to Egypt to recuperate. It was then called up by Titus for his successful but bloody 70 CE Siege of Jerusalem which ended the first phase of the First Jewish Revolt, then sent back to Oescus in 71 CE. There it failed to defend the governor against a Dacian raid by King Decebalus. The legion got it’s chance for revenge during the Second Dacian War in 105-106 CE, helping Trajan complete his conquest of Dacia.
				<br>
				<br>
				After the Dacian Wars it was returned to Moesia, to a new base at Troesmis. In 135 CE, the legion or a large vexillation from it, was shipped to Palestine for the end phase of the Second Jewish Revolt. It successfully besieged Bethar, HQ of the resistance leader Shimeon bar-Kokhba. Once he was killed, the revolt was crushed shortly after and the men of the 5th Macedonica returned home. Marcus Aurelius tasked the 5th to assist in his Eastern campaigns in 161-166 CE, and after was sent back to Europe to be stationed at Potaissa in Dacia. When Emperor Aurelian surrendered Dacia to the barbarian tribes in 274 CE, the 5th moved back to it’s old base at Oescus. Records show that this once proud legion was, by the end of the fourth-century, split up. One part was still in Moesia with it’s cohorts divided among four different locations along the Danube border, the other was in Egypt  along with three other legions and a large number of auxiliary units.</p>

				<p>One of Caesar’s core legions, it spent most of it’s career in Syria, marched on Rome to make Vespasian emperor, participated in the final battles of the Civilis Revolt, then, stationed at Galilee, took the brunt of the Second Jewish Revolt.</p>
				<p class="hide">After the death of Mark Anthony and the end of the civil war, the 6th Ferrata was sent to Raphanaea in Syria, to guard the frontier against the Parthians. Four cohorts participated in the disastrous march against the Jewish rebels in Judea in 66 CE. Three years later the legion marched into Italy with 13,000 Evocati, the retired legionary veteran militia of the empire, plus auxiliaries to dethrone Vitellius and install Vespasian. On the march toward Rome, they heard about Sarmatian raiders that had overrun several auxiliary forts in Moesia, their force turned to advance on the raiders and they caught them unawares, decimating their forces. They returned to their Syrian base in 70 CE, where they stayed until they were used by Trajan in his Parthian campaigns 111-116 CE. Afterwards, Trajan posted the 6th Ferrata at Caparcotna in Galilee in 117 CE, about the same time as the Jewish uprisings in Egypt, Cyrenaica, and Cyprus. In 119 CE the legion was sent to Arabia and then back at Caparcotna, which was renamed Legio, the next year. When the Jews revolted in 132 CE, the 6th Ferrata and the 10th Fretensis took the brunt at the start. The 6th assisted in stomping out the revolt, and it returned to it’s base at Legio. Legio changed it’s name to Maximianus sometime during Emperor Maximianus Galerius’ reign between 303-311 CE, and the records show the 6th remained stationed there for the rest of it’s career.</p>

				<p class="hide">Sent to Spain for the grinding operations of the Cantabrian Wars in 29 BCE, where it likely gained it’s honorific ‘Victrix’ for it’s service there. It remained in Spain until 70 CE, when it marched for the Rhine to help end the Civilis Revolt under the command of Petilius Cerialis. With the revolt put down, the 6th stayed on the Rhine, based at Novaesium before being transferred to another Rhine base at Vetera at the start of the Dacian Wars. Like many of the legions on the Rhine, the 6th sent vexillations in support of Trajan’s operations to conquer Dacia. In 122 CE, it was urgently transferred to Britain to replace the 9th Hispana Legion which disappeared from the records around this time, presumably due to it’s completely destruction by the Caledonians. It was stationed at Eburacum, where it would remain for almost 300 years before being recalled back to Rome by Stilicho, Master of Combined Forces, in 401 CE for his last-ditch defense of Italy against Alaric and his Visigoths. This steadfast and proud legion is thought to have been destroyed by the Visigoths in the battles leading up to the sack of Rome in the year 410 CE.</p>

				<p>Putting down a rebellion for Claudius, this legion fought a hard won battle against the Dacians for Domitian before invading Dacia itself with Trajan, then grinding through Marcus Aurelius’s German Wars, it remained as part of the Danube bulwark well into the fifth-century CE.</p>

At the conclusion of the war it was stationed at Tilurium in Dalmatia throughout the mutiny of 14 CE. In 42 CE, some of the 7th’s legionaries along with legionaries from the 11th legion killed the rebellious governor of Dalmatia, Furius Camillus Scribonianus, and his supporting officers, effectively ending the rebellion to the one year reign of Emperor Claudius. As a reward for their loyalty to him, he awarded both legions the honorific ‘Claudia Pia Fidelis’, and the shipped to Moesia. It would later play a crucial part in Vespasian’s army that marched on Rome to make him emperor. The new emperor sent it back to Viminacium in Moesia where it remained until Domiatian used it for his disastrous war with the Dacians in 88-89 CE. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In 88 CE, however, they were part of a Roman army that defeated the Dacians at the bloody Battle of Tapae in central Dacia, unfortunately this battle had no baring on the outcome of the war, which ended with a treaty that strongly favored the Dacians. After which Domitian separated Meosia into two provinces, Upper and Lower Meosia, with the 7th being stationed at the former. From there it would take part in Trajan’s two Dacian wars of 101-102 CE and 105-106 CE., which finally saw Rome triumph over the Dacians. Returned to it’s long term base at Viminacium, the legion also saw action in the grueling wars waged against the Germans by Marcus Aurelius which took place for most of his reign between 161-180 CE. Records show it was still stationed along the Danube by the end of the fourth-century but had been split into two units; the 7th Seniors and the 7th Juniors.</p>

				<p class="hide">Sulpicius Galba recruited the 7th in his province of Hispania Tarraconensis in 68 CE, giving it the number VII because it was the traditional Spanish recruiting grounds of the 7th Claudia. This new 7th, usually referred to as either the 7th Hispana or 7th Galbiana, marched with Galba to Rome serving as his personal legion for two years, before being sent to Carnuntum in Pannonia. It’s new commander, Marcus Antonius Primus, led the forces that took the throne from Vitellius for Vespasian. Fighting valiantly in the battles to dethrone Vitellius it appears to have taken heavy casualties and Vespasian combined it with remnants from Nero’s reformed 18th Legion. This merger, or “twinning”, of two legions gave it it’s title of Gemina., after which it was sent back to Carnuntum. In 74 CE, Vespasian sent it to Spain where it would create a legion base and sponsor a civilian vices, or town, that would become a city called Legio which in turn grew to be the modern city of Leon. This is where the legion would remain before the records because unreliably after the end of the third-century.</p>

				<p class="hide">One of several legions to earn a title during the arduous Cantabrian Wars of 29-19 BCE, it was stationed in Spain until Augustus sent it to Pannonian to fight in another grinding conflict known as the Pannonian War of 6-9 CE. Thereafter it was stationed at Poetovio in Pannonia until the reign of Claudius where it was sent to Novae in Moesia in 45 CE. In 69 CE it marched for Otho, then, in the wake fo his death, fought for Vespasian in the Italian battles that made him emperor. It was selected to join the army that put down the Civilis Revolt on the Rhine, after which it was stationed at Argentoratum on the Upper Rhine. There it remained for 300 years fighting Germans, Sarmatians, Franks, and Goths. The records show that, by the late fourth-century, one of the twelve palatine legions under command of the Master of Foot was called the Octovani Legion and may have been the 8th Augusta.</p>

				<p>Before become the stuff of legend in the mind of every historian, it was savaged by Boudicca’s Revolt in Britain, victorious against the Caledonians in Scotland, and then disappeared from the records, leaving historians wondering how and where?</p>
				<p class="hide">Earning it’s title in the Cantabrian Wars of 29-19 CE, it was subsequently sent East to fight in the Pannonian War of 6-9 CE for Augustus, after which it was stationed at Siscia in Pannonia. The 9th was chosen as one of the four legions to invade Britain, where it was stationed at Lindum. During the opening stages of Boudicca’s Revolt, in 60 CE, a rash commander, Petilius Cerialis, lead four cohorts against the rebels and were utterly destroyed, with Cerialis barely escaping with some cavalry. At the conclusion of the revolt, the Palatium transferred 2,000 men from the 21st Rapax Legion to replace the ones lost in the revolt, due to unstable social and political situation still ongoing in Britain. The legion transferred North to Eburacum and then later further North to Carlisle, where there were still stationed in 122 CE when he completely disappeared from the record, likely at the hands of Caledonians.</p>

				<p>New evidence pointing to this legion being Caesar’s famous 10th, it had a stellar fighting career rampaging through Armenia and stomping out the Jewish rebels at Jerusalem and Masada, it was almost wiped out during the Second Jewish Revolt.</p>
				<p class="hide">Following Mark Anthony’s death in 30 CE, the 10th Fretensis was stationed in Macedonia in, a province which had some issues during the reign of Augustus. It was sent to the East some two decades later, where it was cut off by Jewish rioters following the death of Harold the Great, king of Judea, in Jerusalem, and had to be rescued by a Roman force led by Quintilius Varus, infamous for the disaster at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. When Germanicus Caesar, commander-in-chief of the East, arrived in Syria in 17 CE, the 10th was stationed at Cyrrhus in Syria. The legion took part in both of Corbulo’s Armenian campaigns, of 52-54 CE and 62 CE, then fought a defensive battle at the Euphrates river against an invasion force of Parthians in 62 CE. Four years later it provided four cohorts for Gallus’ ill-fated counter-offensive against the Jewish rebels in Judea, during which they were repulsed and had to retreat to Caesarea. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Despite this poor performance, Vespasian picked the whole legion for his planned counter-offensive, which ended up being led by Vespasian’s son Titus. The 10th was one of four legions that successfully besieged Jerusalem in what was one of the bloodiest sieges of the era. Amid the ruins of Jerusalem, the 10th built a new legionary base, from which they launched operations that seized the last remaining strongholds of the Jewish rebels, the two fortresses of Machaerus and Masada. In the early stages of the Second Jewish Revolt of 132-135 CE, the 10th suffered extremely high casualties, with all of the cohorts in Jerusalem being completely wiped out forcing Hadrian to transfer Egyptian sailor of the Misene Fleet to the legion, thus granting them full Roman citizenship. The legion was still in Jerusalem as of 230 CE but was transferred a century later to the Red Sea town of Aela, where it came under the command of the Duke of Palestine in the fourth-century CE.</p>

				<p>Involved in many Rome’s most important conflicts - the grinding Cantabrian Wars, shameful Civilis Revolt, the grueling Dacian Wars, and the stalwart defense of the Danube. The 10th could be relied upon to get the job done.</p>
				<p class="hide">Formed by the merger of the other 10th legion and another legion following the conclusion of the civil war, the newly coined 10th Gemina was sent to fight in the ten-year-long Cantabrian Wars. After the war it was stationed at Petavonium in Spain. Sometime in the 60s CE, the 10th was transferred to Carnuntum in Pannonia in preparation fo Nero’s planned invasion of Parthia, but the First Jewish Revolt put those plans on hold and the legion was returned to Spain. It was then marched from Spain to the Rhine in 70 CE to assist in the final phases of Petilius Cerialis’ campaign to stomp out the Civilis Revolt. After which it was stationed at Nijmegen, the Batavian capital, where it built a new stone fortress. It was then transferred in 101 CE to Aquincum to take part in both of Trajan’s Dacian Wars. After the annexation of Dacia in 106 CE, it posted there for twelve years before being sent to Vindabonna in Pannonia. Where it stayed for the rest of its known career, except for a brief few years campaigning with Emperor Aurelian which ended the Crisis of the Third Century and restored the Roman Empire, preventing if from almost certain collapse. Records show it was still in Pannonia as of the late fourth century, but split into two border guard units, commanded by different prefects, and at different locations.</p>

				<p>Serving along the Danube and across it for hundreds of years, this legion would gain fame for staying loyal to Claudius.</p>
				<p class="hide">Following the civil war, the 11th was sent to Dalmatia, which would make it one of the legions at the forefront of the Pannonian War. At the conclusion of the war, it was stationed at Burnum where it would remain through the mutiny of 14 CE, and once more in the revolt of 42 BCE, where legionaries from the 11th and 7th legions killed the rebellious governor, Scribonianus. For this loyalty, the 11th and the 7th were given the honorific ‘Claudia Pia Fidelis’ by Claudius. In 69 CE, they swore for Vespasian but hesitated to march against Vitellius, only joining the march on Rome after the Second Battle of Bedriacum and the Battle of Cremona. After Vespasian took the thrown, the legion was sent to Vindonissa on the Upper Rhine, to replace the disbanded units in the Civilis Revolt. It was later moved to Brigetio along the Danube in 101 CE, where it sat out the the First Dacian War, and took part in the Second Dacian War. After the war, the legion moved to Oescus and then to Durosturum where it set up a permanent base and held the line for 200 years, with exception for a brief assignment where either the whole legion or a vexillation were sent to Palestine to take part in final phase of the offensive against the Jewish rebels in the Second Jewish Revolt.</p>

				<p>Disgraced in the disastrous Armenian campaign of Paetus, and again in the First Jewish Revolt, it proved itself when given a third chance however, then lived up to their name fighting for Marcus Aurelius by winning a battle in a thunderstorm.</p>
				<p class="hide">The 12th Legion was sent to Egypt at the conclusion of the civil war, taking part in the invasion of Ethiopia in 22 BCE. It was moved to Raphanaea is Syria in 14 CE, to be stationed with the 6th Ferrata, where it stayed until called up for the 62 CE campaign into Armenia by Paetus. During the campaign, which was hastily planned and executed, the legion shamed itself when it became surrounded in it’s fort and refused to fight it’s way out. It retreated back to Syria, without most of it’s supplies or siege equipment. There the legion stayed for four years, until being called up by Gallus for his march on Jerusalem to put down in the First Jewish Revolt. They were turned back, and during the retreat their eagle standard was taken by the rebels, once again the 12th Legion had disgraced itself. Vespasian refused to use this legion for his planned operation into Judea because of it’s poor performance but with his march to Rome, Titus took the reins and was quick to use the 12th for his siege of Jerusalem. Eager to regain their lost valor, they performed well during the siege, so well in fact that Vespasian posted the legion to the newly annexed Cappadocia in 71 CE, becoming the province’s home legion, at their new base at Melitene.
				<br>
				<br>
				The 12th’s home base remained at Melitene for the next 300 years, from there it regained it’s reputation. In 135 CE, it was part of Arrian’s campaign against the invading Alans in Lesser Armenia, there the legionaries helped Arrian turn back 10,000+ all armored cavalry force. Several decades later, it was transferred to the Danube for Marcus Aurelius’ Germanic wars, helping to fight back the Alemanni and the Quadi German incursions. The King of the Quadi, Ariogaesus, rejoined the war in 174 CE, leading a surprise attack across the Danube. Marcus Aurelius, with his body guard, took the 12th legion and it’s auxiliaries out to meet the Quadi. In this famous battle, the 12th officially earned their title and emblem, when they fought to victory under a fierce lightening storm while outnumbered and surrounded. Records show that the legion went back to Melitene and that by the late fourth-century CE was moved to Armenia along with the 15th Apollinaris, but reduced to border guard units.</p>

				<p>Always on the forefront, the mighty 13th fought in Germany for Germanicus, was on the losing and then the winning side of the 69 CE war of succession, and fiercely stormed the Dacian capital in the final stage of the Second Dacian War.</p>
				<p class="hide">After the civil war, Octavian combined two legions, consisting of one or possibly both 13th Legions, one being Octavian's and the other was Anthony’s. Those the 13th Gemina was born, with recorded lineage dating back to 205 BCE, which was rare for most legions, the 13th began it’s career fighting against Germans one both sides of the Rhine river. It was then to take part in the 15 BCE operation that made Raetia a province. From there it was in a perfect position to react to the Pannonian Revolt in 6 CE and fight a hard campaign to regain control of the provinces, just in time top be quickly transferred to defend the Rhine in the wake of the Virus disaster in 9 CE. It took part in Germanicus’ operations of revenge against the Germans between 14-16 CE, before being transferred to Poetovio in 46 CE. It marched for Otho in 69 CE, where it dishonored itself during the First Battle of Bedriacum, with both sides despising the legion because of it’s poor performance. They were then put to work by Vitellius to build wooden amphitheaters at Cremona and Bononia, where Vitellius and his generals would celebrate their victory, and was then sent back to Poetovio.
				<br>
				<br>
				When Vespasian was hailed as emperor later that year, the 13th was quick to join the forces on their march into Italy, and with the dishonor hanging over their head, they fought valiantly in the Second Battle of Bedriacum, Battle of Cremona, and Battle of Rome.The 13th was sent back to Poetovio where it remained until 97 CE when it was transferred to Vindonissa. It was called up to take part in both of Trajan’s Dacian Wars, and once Dacia was conquered it set up a base at Apulum in the newly conquered province. From it’s new base it would continually fight against multiple incursions by tribes from the German, Sarmatian, and Gothic people. Emperor Aurelian abandoned the province in 274 CE, finding the province too vulnerable and lacking natural defenses, in favor of the much more defendable Danube river, The legion moved to a new Moesian base at Ratiara, where it remained for the rest of it’s career. Records show that as of 395 CE, the legion had been split apart; part was still based at Ratiara and the other in Egypt.
